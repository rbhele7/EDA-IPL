Welcome to the IPL Exploratory Data Analysis onboarding project! This repository contains a curated set of challenges designed to teach the fundamentals of data aggregation, pandas manipulation, and data visualization.

## The Goal
There are 10 issues (`#E1` through `#E10`) split into exactly three difficulty zones to give you a perfect learning progression:

1. **Easy (#E1, #E2, #E3)**: Gentle introductions. Basic loading, column filtering, and checking data types using simple grouping.
2. **Medium (#E4, #E5, #E6, #E7)**: Intermediate-level tasks. You will be filtering for specific stages of the tournament (Playoffs, Death Overs), merging multiple datasets, and creating dimensional plots (like nested bar charts).
3. **Hard (#E8, #E9, #E10)**: Advanced challenges. These demand multi-step logic operations like stateful iterations for batting partnerships or deriving exact mathematical correlations (like Pearson correlation for scoring rates).

## The Data
We are using the IPL Dataset containing `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv`. The dataset is included right here in the `data/` folder of this repository so you can load it instantly without downloading anything.

## Contribution Guidelines
Follow these exact steps to complete an issue and get on the leaderboard!

### Workflow
1. **Fork & Branch:** Fork this repository on GitHub. Clone your fork to your local machine, enter the repository folder, and create a new branch for the issue:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix-E1
   ```
2. **Code & Override:** Open your notebook in Google Colab (or locally) and complete the required analysis. Once finished, download the updated `.ipynb` file to your machine and overwrite the old specific notebook file inside the repository.
3. **Commit & Push:** Stage your updated notebooks, commit your changes, and push the branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git add notebooks/
   git commit -m "Solved issue #E1"
   git push origin fix-E1
   ```

### Open a Pull Request
Open a Pull Request (PR) from your newly pushed branch into the main repository. 
* Ensure you include the closing tag in the description (e.g., `Closes #E1`) so it automatically links to the issue!

### Mandatory PR Description
In the description box of your Pull Request, you **MUST** explicitly provide:
1. **Visualization:** A clear screenshot of your generated plot.
2. **Core Logic:** A copy/paste of the core logic code block you built to reach the result.
3. **Insight Summary:** A markdown section titled `## Insight Summary` that interprets your findings.

### Evaluation
We will review your Pull Request based on the summary and logic provided in the description. Upon passing the review, your PR will be approved and closed, and you will instantly be awarded your points on the main leaderboard!
